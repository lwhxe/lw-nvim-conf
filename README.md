### Installation Guide

Install [NeoVim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) for Windows.
Make sure to follow the installation steps.

    cd %appdata%/../Local
    mkdir nvim
    git clone https://github.com/lwhxe/lw-nvim-conf nvim

Now run the "nvim" command from anywhere in the terminal. Wait 1-5 minutes for the install to complete. *Grab a coffee or something.*

There might be errors. To fix this, just restart NeoVim by using ":q" and running the command again.
